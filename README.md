## ðŸ‘¾ Techstack

- Astro & React
- Tailwind & Shadcn
- Typescript

## ðŸŒ¿ Branches

Our project uses the following branch structure:

- `main`: Production-ready code. This branch is deployed to the live environment and should remain stable at all times.
- `test`: Testing/staging branch where features are integrated and tested before being merged to `main`.
- `dev/name`: Development branches where individual contributors work on features or fixes. Replace "name" with your name (e.g., `dev/ahmad`, `dev/sarah`).

### Branch Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `test` using the format `dev/your-name`
2. Implement your feature or fix in your development branch
3. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the `test` branch
4. After testing and review in the `test` environment, changes are merged into `main`

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/

â”œâ”€â”€ public/             # Static assets (fonts, images, etc.)
â””â”€â”€â”€src
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€assets/         # Assets that'll be used inside in the App (SVGs, Images)
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€components/     # UI components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€common      # Shared components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€features    # Feature-specific components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€seo         # SEO-specific components
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ui          # Shadcn installed components (no need to edit)
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€content         # Static Content goes here (course data, professors, blogs)
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€data            # Data (siteData, etc.)

    â”œâ”€â”€â”€lib             # code logic goes here
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€stores          # State Management
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€styles
    â””â”€â”€â”€utils           # Helper functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro     # index page at https://gju.app/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs        # Astro configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # The file you're reading now
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
